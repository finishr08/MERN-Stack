# JavaScript

**What is JavaScript?**

- A high-level, interpreted programming language.
- Primarily used to add interactivity to web pages.
- Makes web pages dynamic and responsive to user actions.

**Why is JavaScript Important?**

- Essential for creating modern, engaging web experiences.
- Powers features like:
    - Interactive forms
    - Animations
    - Data validation
    - Single-page applications (SPAs)
    - Can also be used for server-side development (Node.js) and game development.
    
## Variables

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords: `let`, `var`, and `const`. These keywords determine the scope and mutability (the ability to change the value) of the variable.

**`let` keyword**
   - Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) for block-level scoping.
   - Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block they are defined in (e.g., `if` statement, loop, or the entire code block wrapped in curly braces `{}`).
   - You can reassign values to `let` variables, making them mutable.

   ```javascript
   if (true) {
       let x = 10;
       console.log(x); // Output: 10 (accessible within the if block)
   }

   console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined (x is not accessible outside the if block)
   ```

**`var` keyword**
   - Introduced in the early days of JavaScript, it has function-level scoping.
   - Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the entire function they are defined in, regardless of code blocks.
   - `var` variables are also mutable.

   ```javascript
   function someFunction() {
       var y = 20;
       if (true) {
           console.log(y); // Output: 20 (accessible within the function)
       }
   }

   someFunction();
   ```

    Due to its function-level scoping, `var` can lead to unintended variable behavior, especially when dealing with nested functions. It's generally recommended to use `let` or `const` for better control and to avoid potential pitfalls.

**`const` keyword**
   - Introduced in ES6, `const` creates variables that hold constant values.
   - Once assigned a value, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned. This helps prevent accidental modifications and improves code readability.

   ```javascript
   const PI = 3.14159;
   PI = 123; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
   ```

## Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types to represent different kinds of information:

- **Numbers:** Integers (whole numbers) and floating-point numbers (decimals). Examples: `10`, `-5.23`, `0.00001`.
- **Strings:** Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Examples: `"Hello"`, `'World'`, `"This is a string"`.
- **Booleans:** Represent logical truth values: `true` or `false`.
- **Objects:** Collections of key-value pairs used to store complex data structures.
- **Arrays:** Ordered lists of values, similar to numbered boxes that can hold different types of data.
- **Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
- **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Symbol:** A unique and immutable primitive value used as an object property key.

## Operators & Precedence

Operators are used to perform calculations, comparisons, and other manipulations on data. JavaScript follows operator precedence rules to determine the order of operations in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. Here's a simplified table (higher precedence at the top):

```
**Operator**        **Description**                                     **Associativity**
------------------ -------------------------------------------------- ---------------
`()`, `[]`, `.`,  Function calls, property access, array indexing       Left to right
`postfix ++`,        Post-increment/decrement                             Right to left
`prefix ++`, `--`,  Pre-increment/decrement, unary plus/minus          Right to left
`*, /, %`           Multiplication, division, modulo                     Left to right
`+`, `-`            Addition, subtraction                                 Left to right
`<`, `>`, `<=`,     Comparison operators (less than, greater than, etc.)  Left to right
`==`, `!=`, `===`,  Equality and strict equality operators              Left to right
`&&`                Logical AND                                         Left to right
`||`                Logical OR                                          Left to right
`!`                 Logical NOT                                        Right to left
`=`                 Assignment                                          Right to left
```

**`NaN` (Not a Number)**

The `NaN` value represents a result that is not a valid number, often arising from operations that don't produce numerical results.

I'd be glad to explain assignment operators, unary operators, binary operators, and identifier rules in JavaScript with code examples:

## Assignment Operators

These operators assign a value to a variable on the left side based on the expression on the right side.

- **Simple Assignment (`=`):** Assigns the value on the right directly to the variable on the left.

```javascript
let age = 25;
console.log(age); // Output: 25
```

- **Compound Assignment Operators (combine assignment and operation)**
  - `+=`: Adds and assigns
  - `-=`: Subtracts and assigns
  - `*=`: Multiplies and assigns
  - `/=`: Divides and assigns
  - `%=`: Modulo (remainder) and assigns

```javascript
let count = 10;
count += 5; // Equivalent to count = count + 5
console.log(count); // Output: 15
```

## Unary Operators

These operators operate on a single operand (value).

- **Increment (`++`):** Increases the operand by 1 (can be pre-increment `++x` or post-increment `x++`).
- **Decrement (`--`):** Decreases the operand by 1 (can be pre-decrement `--x` or post-decrement `x--`).
- **Negate (`-`):** Converts a number to its negative equivalent.
- **Logical NOT (`!`):** Inverts the boolean value (true becomes false, false becomes true).

```javascript
let num = 3;
console.log(++num); // Output: 4 (pre-increment, num becomes 4)
console.log(num--); // Output: 4 (post-decrement, uses the current value 4)
console.log(num);  // Output: 3 (num is now 3 after decrement)

let isTrue = true;
console.log(!isTrue); // Output: false
```

## Binary Operators

These operators require two operands (values) to perform an operation.

- **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`):** Perform basic mathematical operations.
- **Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`):** Compare values and return true or false.
- **Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`):** Combine boolean expressions.
- **Bitwise Operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`):** Perform bit-level operations on numbers (less common).

```javascript
let a = 10, b = 5;
console.log(a + b);   // Output: 15 (addition)
console.log(a == b);  // Output: false (equality)
console.log(a && b);   // Output: 5 (logical AND, returns the second value)
console.log(a || b);   // Output: 10 (logical OR, returns the first truthy value)
```

## Identifier Rules

Identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) in JavaScript must follow these guidelines:

- **Start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_).**
- **Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores after the first character.**
- **Case-sensitive (e.g., `age` is different from `Age`).**
- **Cannot be reserved keywords (words with special meanings in JavaScript like `let`, `function`, `const`).**

Here are some valid and invalid identifiers:

```javascript
let firstName = "Alice";   // Valid
let _age = 30;            // Valid (starts with underscore)
let total$ = 100;         // Invalid (special character other than underscore)
let while = 10;           // Invalid (reserved keyword)
```

*By understanding these operators and identifier rules, you can effectively write JavaScript code to manipulate data and create complex logic.*


## Boolean Data Type

- Represent logical values: `true` or `false`.
- Used for conditional statements and comparisons.
- Example:

```javascript
let isSunny = true;
let isWeekend = false;

if (isSunny && isWeekend) {
  console.log("Perfect day for a picnic!");
}
```

## String Data Type

- Represent sequences of characters (text).
- Enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
- Can be used for displaying text, storing user input, etc.
- **String Indexes:** You can access individual characters within a string using their zero-based index. The first character has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.

```javascript
let message = "Hello, world!";

console.log(message[0]); // Output: "H" (character at index 0)
console.log(message.length); // Output: 14 (length of the string)
```

## Null Data Type

- A special value that indicates the absence of an object value.
- Not the same as an empty string or zero.
- Often used to represent intentional absence of data.

```javascript
let emptyBox = null;

console.log(emptyBox); // Output: null (no value assigned)
```

## Undefined Data Type

- Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- Also indicates a function's return value if the function doesn't explicitly return anything.
- Can lead to errors if not handled properly.

```javascript
let name;

console.log(name); // Output: undefined (declared but not assigned)

function greet() {
  // No return statement, so it implicitly returns undefined
}

let greeting = greet();
console.log(greeting); // Output: undefined
```

*Understanding these data types is crucial for working with variables and data in JavaScript. By using Booleans for logical operations, Strings for text, Null for intentional absence, and Undefined for variables declared but not assigned, you can write clear and efficient code.*

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. Developed by Microsoft, it offers several advantages for building large-scale and maintainable JavaScript applications.

**Key Features of TypeScript:**

- **Static Typing:** You can optionally define the data types (like number, string, boolean) of variables and function parameters. This helps catch errors early in the development process, improving code reliability.
- **Improved Tooling:** Code editors and IDEs can provide better code completion, refactoring, and error checking thanks to TypeScript's type annotations.
- **Transpilation:** TypeScript code is compiled into plain JavaScript that can run in any browser or JavaScript environment.
- **Interoperability:** Existing JavaScript code can be used seamlessly within TypeScript projects, making the transition smoother.

**Benefits of Using TypeScript:**

- **Reduced Errors:** Static typing helps prevent runtime errors by catching type mismatches during compilation.
- **Improved Code Readability:** Explicit type definitions make code easier to understand for yourself and other developers.
- **Better Maintainability:** Types make code more maintainable as the project grows, as changes are less likely to break unintended parts of the codebase.
- **Large-Scale Development:** TypeScript is well-suited for building complex applications as it promotes better organization and structure.

**Who Should Use TypeScript?**

While not strictly necessary for small projects, TypeScript is a valuable tool for:

- Developers working on large-scale or complex JavaScript applications.
- Teams collaborating on a codebase to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- Those who want to improve the reliability and readability of their JavaScript code.

## console.log

- **Purpose:** Used for debugging and logging messages to the browser's developer console.
- **Syntax:** `console.log(message1, message2, ...messageN);`
  - `messageN`: Any data type you want to output (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.).
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  const age = 30;
  console.log("My age is:", age);
  ```

## Linking JavaScript Files

- **`<script>` Tag:**
  - Place a `<script>` tag at the end of your HTML file to link an external JavaScript file:
    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Content</h1>
        <script src="myScript.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
  - The `src` attribute specifies the path to your JavaScript file.

## Template Literals

- **Purpose:** Create multi-line strings and embed expressions for cleaner string manipulation.
- **Syntax:** Use backticks (`) instead of quotes, with embedded expressions inside `${}`:
  ```javascript
  const name = "Alice";
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}! How are you today?`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice! How are you today?
  ```
- **Multiline Strings:** Template literals allow writing multi-line strings without concatenation:
  ```javascript
  const message = `This is a
  multiline string
  using template literals.`;
  console.log(message);
  ```

**JavaScript** operators are the building blocks that manipulate values, perform calculations, and control the flow of your code. Here's are some common operator types:

## Arithmetic Operators

- Used for mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation)
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const sum = 10 + 5;
  const difference = 20 - 7;
  const product = 3 * 4;
  console.log(sum, difference, product); // Output: 15 13 12
  ```

## Assignment Operators

- Assign values to variables.
- Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` (and similar for other operators)
  - The combined operators (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) perform the operation and then assign the result.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let count = 0;
  count += 2;  // Equivalent to count = count + 2;
  count *= 3;
  console.log(count); // Output: 6
  ```

## Comparison Operators

- Compare values for equality, inequality, greater than/less than, etc.
- Operators: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Use `===` for strict equality (checks type and value), and `!==` for strict inequality.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const a = 10;
  const b = "10";
  console.log(a == b);  // true (loose equality)
  console.log(a === b); // false (strict equality, different types)
  ```

## Logical Operators

- Combine conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `else`)
- Operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const age = 25;
  const isCitizen = true;
  if (age >= 18 && isCitizen) {
      console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
  }
  ```

## Other Operators

- **Unary Operators:** `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), `typeof` (check data type), `delete` (remove property)
- **Ternary Operator:** `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse` (shorthand conditional)
- **Bitwise Operators:** Perform bit-level operations (advanced usage)


## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in JavaScript are fundamental for controlling the flow of your code based on certain conditions. Here's a breakdown of the main ones:

### if Statement

- Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- Syntax:
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if condition is true
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const age = 25;
  if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You are an adult.");
  }
  ```

### else Statement

- Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the `if` condition is false.
- Syntax:
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if condition is true
  } else {
      // Code to execute if condition is false
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const isWeekend = true;
  if (isWeekend) {
      console.log("Enjoy your weekend!");
  } else {
      console.log("Back to work!");
  }
  ```

### else if Statement

- Allows checking for multiple conditions sequentially.
- Syntax:
  ```javascript
  if (condition1) {
      // Code to execute if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
      // Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  } else {
      // Code to execute if all previous conditions are false
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const grade = 85;
  if (grade >= 90) {
      console.log("Excellent!");
  } else if (grade >= 80) {
      console.log("Very good!");
  } else {
      console.log("Keep practicing!");
  }
  ```

### Nested if-else

In JavaScript, nested `if` and `else` statements allow you to create complex decision-making logic by checking multiple conditions within a single block. Here's a breakdown:

**Nested `if` with `else`**

   ```javascript
   if (condition1) {
       if (condition2) {
           // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
       } else {
           // Code to execute if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
       }
   } else {
       // Code to execute if condition1 is false
   }
   ```

**Nested `if`/`else if` chains**

   ```javascript
   if (condition1) {
       // Code to execute if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
   } else if (condition3) {
       // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
   } else {
       // Code to execute if all previous conditions are false
   }
   ```

**Example:**

```javascript
const grade = 88;
let letterGrade;

if (grade >= 90) {
    letterGrade = "A";
} else if (grade >= 80) {
    letterGrade = "B";
} else if (grade >= 70) {
    letterGrade = "C";
} else {
    letterGrade = "D or F";
}

console.log("Your letter grade is:", letterGrade);
```

In this example, the code checks the `grade` value against multiple conditions and assigns the corresponding letter grade.


**Tips**

- Always use curly braces `{}` to group the code within each conditional block, even if it's a single line.
- Indentation is recommended for better readability, but not strictly enforced by JavaScript.
- Choose the appropriate conditional statement based on the complexity of your conditions.

*By effectively using these conditional statements, you can make your JavaScript code more dynamic and responsive to different scenarios.*

### Switch Statements

In JavaScript, switch statements offer a structured approach to handling multiple conditional checks based on the value of a single expression. They are particularly useful when you want to compare a value against several possible options and execute specific code blocks for each match.

```javascript
const day = "Wednesday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Start of the week!");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
  case "Wednesday":
  case "Thursday":
    console.log("Midweek grind.");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("TGIF!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Enjoy your weekend!");
}
```

*In this example, the day variable is evaluated in the switch statement. If it matches "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", or "Thursday", the corresponding message is printed. Otherwise, the default message is used.*

## Alert & Prompt

Alert and prompt are built-in functions in JavaScript used for interacting with the user through modal dialog boxes. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

### Alert

- **Purpose:** Displays a simple message box with an "OK" button that the user must click to dismiss.
- **Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  alert(message);
  ```
  - `message`: The string you want to display in the alert box.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  alert("Hello, world!");
  ```
  When you run this code, a modal window will appear with the message "Hello, world!" and an "OK" button. The user must click "OK" to proceed.

### Prompt

- **Purpose:** Displays a dialog box with a message, an input field for the user to enter text, and "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.
- **Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  const userInput = prompt(message, defaultValue);
  ```
  - `message`: The text displayed before the input field.
  - `defaultValue` (optional): The initial value displayed in the input field (can be a string or null).
- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the text entered by the user if they click "OK," or `null` if they click "Cancel" or close the dialog box without entering any text.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  const name = prompt("What is your name?");
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  ```
  This code displays a prompt asking the user for their name. When the user enters their name and clicks "OK," the code stores the entered name in the `name` variable and then prints a greeting message using `console.log`. If the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the dialog box without entering anything, `null` will be assigned to `name`, and the console might log `"Hello, null!"` if appropriate error handling isn't implemented.

**Important!**

- Both `alert` and `prompt` can disrupt the user experience by pausing script execution and forcing users to interact with the modal dialog. Use them sparingly and consider alternative approaches like providing informational messages within the webpage itself or using more interactive UI elements.
- The `prompt` function's return value can be `null`, so always check for this before using the entered text in your code to avoid potential errors. You might want to implement validation or provide a default value if the user cancels the prompt.
- These functions are generally used for simple interactions. For more complex user input and interactions, consider using HTML forms and JavaScript event listeners.

*By understanding the use cases and limitations of `alert` and `prompt`, you can effectively incorporate them in your JavaScript code when appropriate.*


## JavaScript Strings

In JavaScript, strings are a fundamental data type used to represent sequences of characters, like text, numbers, symbols, or even emojis. They are essential for building user interfaces, processing data, and interacting with the web.

Here's a key points about strings in JavaScript:

## Creating Strings

* You can create strings using single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (``). These quotes act as delimiters, defining the beginning and end of the string.
* Backticks, also known as template literals, offer special features like embedded expressions and multiline strings, making them versatile for complex string creation.

**Example:**

```javascript
let message = 'This is a string';
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
let multiline = `This is a 
multiline string.`;
```

## String Methods

JavaScript offers a rich set of methods for manipulating and working with strings. Here's a breakdown of some commonly used methods:

### Character Extraction

* **charAt(index)**: Returns the character at the specified index of the string. Remember, indexing starts from 0.
* **charCodeAt(index)**: Returns the Unicode character code at the specified index.
* **[] operator (like arrays)**: Similar to `charAt`, you can use square brackets with the index to access a character. However, this is generally discouraged due to potential confusion with arrays.

**Example:**

```javascript
let str = "Hello";
let firstChar = str.charAt(0); // "H"
let charCode = str.charCodeAt(1); // 101 (ASCII code for 'e')
let thirdChar = str[2]; // "l" (using square bracket notation)
```

### Extracting Substrings

* **slice(start, end)**: Extracts a section of the string from the specified `start` index (inclusive) up to but not including the `end` index.
* **substring(start, end)**: Similar to `slice`, but it allows negative indices and handles them by counting from the end of the string. This method might be deprecated in future versions of JavaScript, so using `slice` is recommended.
* **substr(start, length)**: Extracts a substring of length `length` from the `start` index. Unlike `slice` and `substring`, it does not handle negative indices.

**Example:**

```javascript
let str = "JavaScript";
let sub1 = str.slice(4, 8); // "Scri"
let sub2 = str.substring(0, 4); // "Java" (notice how it excludes the 4th character)
let sub3 = str.substr(2, 3); // "vaS"
console.log(sub1);
console.log(sub2);
console.log(sub3);
```

### Searching and Replacing

* **indexOf(searchValue, fromIndex)**: Returns the first index at which the specified `searchValue` appears in the string, starting from the optional `fromIndex`. It returns -1 if not found.
* **lastIndexOf(searchValue, fromIndex)**: Similar to `indexOf`, but it returns the last occurrence of the `searchValue`.
* **includes(searchValue, fromIndex)**: Returns true if the string includes the `searchValue`, starting from the optional `fromIndex`, and false otherwise.
* **startsWith(searchValue, fromIndex)**: Checks if the string starts with the specified `searchValue`, starting from the optional `fromIndex`.
* **endsWith(searchValue, length)**: Checks if the string ends with the specified `searchValue`, optionally considering the `length` of characters from the end.
* **replace(searchValue, newValue)**: Returns a new string with all occurrences of `searchValue` replaced by `newValue`.

**Example:**

```javascript
let str = "Hello, world!";
let index = str.indexOf("world"); // 7
let lastIndex = str.lastIndexOf("!"); // 12
let hasWorld = str.includes("world"); // true
let startsWithHello = str.startsWith("Hello"); // true
let endsWithExclamation = str.endsWith("!", 3); // true (considering only last 3 characters)
let newStr = str.replace("world", "JavaScript"); // "Hello, JavaScript!"
```

### Case Conversion

* **toUpperCase()**: Converts the string to uppercase.
* **toLowerCase()**: Converts the string to lowercase.

**Example:**

```javascript
let str = "JavaScript";
let upper = str.toUpperCase(); // JAVASCRIPT
let lower = str.toLowerCase(); // javascript
```

### Other Useful Methods

* **trim()**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace characters.
* **trimStart() or trimLeft()**: Removes leading whitespace characters.
* **trimEnd() or trimRight()**: Removes trailing whitespace characters.
* **concat(str1, str2, ...)**: Concatenates (joins) multiple strings into a new string.
* **split(separator, limit)**: Splits the string into an array of substrings based on the specified `separator`. Optionally, you can limit the number of splits with the `limit` parameter.


## JavaScript Arrays

In JavaScript, arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store an ordered collection of items of any data type. They offer a flexible way to group and manage related information. Here's a deep dive into arrays in JavaScript:

### Creating Arrays

* **Array literal:** This is the most common and concise way to create an array. You use square brackets `[]` and list the elements separated by commas.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let numbers = [1, 2.5, 3];
let mixedArray = [true, "hello", null];
```

* **`new Array()` constructor:** This method can also be used to create arrays, but it's less preferred due to its verbosity. You can optionally pass arguments specifying the initial length or elements.

```javascript
let emptyArray = new Array(); // Creates an empty array
let prefilledArray = new Array(3); // Creates an array with 3 empty slots (length = 3)
let filledArray = new Array("kiwi", "mango"); // Creates an array with specified elements
```

### Accessing and Modifying Elements

* **Indexes:** Each element in an array has a unique numerical index, starting from 0. You can access elements using their index within square brackets.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let firstFruit = fruits[0]; // "apple"
let lastFruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1]; // "orange" (accessing by length)
```

* **Modifying elements:** You can directly modify elements by assigning a new value to their index.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits[1] = "mango"; // Replaces "banana" with "mango"
```

**Important!**

* Arrays are **dynamic**, meaning their size can change as you add or remove elements.
* JavaScript arrays are **mutable**, meaning you can modify the content of the array after it's created.

### Adding and Removing Elements

* **`push()` method:** Appends one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits.push("grapefruit"); // Adds "grapefruit" to the end
```

* **`pop()` method:** Removes and returns the last element from the array.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapefruit"];
let lastFruit = fruits.pop(); // Removes and stores the last element 'grapefruit'
```

* **`unshift()` method:** Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits.unshift("watermelon"); // Adds "watermelon" to the beginning
```

* **`shift()` method:** Removes and returns the first element from the array.

```javascript
let fruits = ["banana", "orange", "watermelon"];
let firstFruit = fruits.shift(); // Removes and stores the first element
```

* **`splice()` method:** This versatile method allows you to insert, remove, or replace elements at any specified position in the array.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"];

// Remove the element at index 1 (banana)
let removedFruit = fruits.splice(1, 1);
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "orange", "mango"]
console.log(removedFruit); // ["banana"]

// Insert "kiwi" at index 2
fruits.splice(2, 0, "kiwi");
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]

// Replace "mango" with "grapefruit" at index 3
fruits.splice(3, 1, "grapefruit");
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "grapefruit"]
```

### Additional Array Methods

JavaScript provides a rich set of built-in methods for working with arrays. Here are some commonly used ones:

* **`join(separator)`:** Creates and returns a new string by concatenating all array elements, separated by the specified `separator` (e.g., comma by default).
* **`slice(start, end)`:** Extracts a section of the array and returns a new array.
* **`concat(array1, array2, ...)`:** Creates and returns a new array by merging two or more arrays.
* **`indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)`:** Searches for the first occurrence of the `searchElement` and returns its index, or -1 if not found.
* **`lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)`:** Similar to `indexOf`, but returns the last occurrence.

## JavaScript Loops

Loops are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript for repeated execution of code. Here's a breakdown of `for` and `while` loops:

## for Loop

The `for` loop is a concise way to iterate a specific number of times or loop until a certain condition is met. It has a general syntax:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

- **Initialization:** This expression is executed only once before the loop starts. Typically used to initialize a loop counter variable.
- **Condition:** This expression is evaluated before every loop iteration. The loop continues as long as the condition is `true`.
- **Increment/Decrement:** This expression is executed after each iteration. Often used to update the loop counter.

**Example:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration", i);
}
```

*This loop will print "Iteration" followed by the numbers 0 to 4 (5 times).*

## while Loop

The `while` loop continues executing a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `true`. It has a simpler syntax:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

- **Condition:** This expression is evaluated before every loop iteration. The loop continues as long as the condition is `true`.

**Example:**

```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
  console.log("Count:", count);
  count++;
}
```

This loop will print "Count:" followed by the numbers 0, 1, and 2 (3 times) because `count` is incremented after each iteration.

### Choosing the Right Loop

- Use `for` loops when you know the exact number of iterations beforehand.
- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations depends on a condition that may change within the loop.

### Additional Considerations!

- You can use `break` to exit a loop prematurely and `continue` to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and jump to the next.
- Be cautious of infinite loops by ensuring your condition eventually evaluates to `false`.

## Additional Loops

In JavaScript, you have two main loop constructs for iterating over elements in collections: `for...of` and `for...in`. They serve different purposes:

### for...of Loop (Introduced in ES6)

- Used to iterate over the **values** of iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more.
- Provides a simpler and more modern syntax for looping through the elements themselves.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (const element of iterable) {
  // code to be executed for each element
}
```

- `const element`: This declares a variable to store the current element in each iteration. You can use `let` as well for modification.
- `iterable`: This is the object you want to iterate over (array, string, etc.).

**Example:**

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit); // Prints "apple", "banana", "cherry"
}
```

### for...in Loop

- Used to iterate over the **enumerable properties** (keys) of an object, including inherited properties.
- Not ideal for arrays if you specifically need the element values because it also iterates over non-numeric properties (like custom methods added to the array).

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (const key in object) {
  // code to be executed for each key
  console.log(key, object[key]); // Access the value using the key
}
```

- `const key`: This variable stores the property name (key) in each iteration.
- `object`: This is the object you want to iterate over.

**Example:**

```javascript
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, greet() { console.log("Hello!"); } };
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]); // Prints "name", "age", "greet"
}
```

### Key Differences

| Feature        | for...of Loop | for...in Loop |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Iterates over   | Values          | Enumerable Keys |
| Best for        | Arrays, Strings, Maps, Sets | Objects       |
| Order           | Preserves order (for iterables with a defined order) | Doesn't necessarily preserve order |
| Prototype chain | Doesn't iterate over inherited properties | Iterates over inherited properties as well |

### Choosing the Right Loop

- Use `for...of` when you need to access the actual elements (values) in arrays, strings, and other iterables.
- Use `for...in` cautiously when iterating over objects, especially if order matters, and only if you need to access properties by their names. In most cases, consider alternative methods like `Object.keys()` for working with object properties.

## JavaScript Objects

Objects are fundamental building blocks used to store data and organize it in a meaningful way. You can think of them as containers that hold collections of key-value pairs.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts about objects in JavaScript:

### Properties and Methods

* An object is a collection of properties. Each property has a name (key) and a value. The value can be any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other objects.
* Methods are special properties that contain functions. These functions can operate on the object's data or perform actions related to the object.

### Creating Objects

There are two main ways to create objects in JavaScript:

* **Object literal syntax:** This is the most common way. You use curly braces `{}` to enclose a list of key-value pairs separated by commas.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Smith",
  age: 30
};
```

* **Object constructor:** You can use the `new Object()` constructor to create an empty object. However, the object literal syntax is generally preferred for readability.

### Accessing Properties and Methods

* You can access an object's property using its name enclosed in dot notation (`.`) or bracket notation (`[]`). Bracket notation is useful when the property name is a variable or contains special characters.

```javascript
const name = person.firstName; // Accessing property using dot notation
const age = person["age"];  // Accessing property using bracket notation
```

* Methods are invoked using the same syntax as accessing properties, followed by parentheses `()`.

```javascript
person.greet();  // Assuming there's a greet method defined on the person object
```

### Object Inheritance

* Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is a powerful mechanism for code reusability. In JavaScript, inheritance is prototypal-based.

## JavaScript Functions

In JavaScript, functions are fundamental building blocks. They are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Here's what functions are and how they work:

**Purpose:**

* Functions encapsulate a set of instructions to perform a particular operation.
* They promote code reusability by allowing you to call the same code multiple times with different inputs (if needed).
* Functions improve code organization by separating functionalities into manageable blocks.

**Structure:**

* A function definition typically follows this format:

```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // Code to be executed
  return value; // Optional, specifies the value returned by the function
}
```

* `functionName`:  A unique name that identifies the function.
* `parameter1, parameter2, ...`: (Optional) A comma-separated list of parameters (inputs) the function accepts.
* `// Code to be executed`: The statements that define the function's logic. This code executes when the function is called.
* `return value;`: (Optional) An expression that specifies the value the function returns after execution. If not specified, the function returns `undefined`.

### Calling Functions

* To execute a function, you use the function name followed by parentheses:

```javascript
functionName(argument1, argument2, ...);
```

* `argument1, argument2, ...`: The actual values you provide to the function's parameters. These values are used within the function's code.

**Example:**

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

const result = add(5, 3); // Calls the add function with arguments 5 and 3
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

**Key Points:**

* Functions can be defined before or after they are called in your code.
* Functions can take zero or more parameters.
* Functions can return a value or not return anything (return `undefined`).
* JavaScript allows for anonymous functions (functions without a name) and function expressions (assigning functions to variables).

## Scope in JavaScript

In JavaScript, scope defines the accessibility of variables and functions within your code. It determines where a variable or function can be referenced and used. There are three main types of scope in JavaScript:

### Global Scope
    * This is the outermost scope, encompassing your entire JavaScript program.
    * Variables declared directly in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code.
    * It's generally recommended to minimize using global variables as they can lead to naming conflicts and make code harder to reason about.

### Function Scope (Before ES6)
    * Prior to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), JavaScript primarily relied on function scope.
    * Variables declared with `var` inside a function are only accessible within that function and its nested functions (if any).
    * This means the variable's lifetime is tied to the function's execution.

### Block Scope (Introduced in ES6)
    * With ES6, JavaScript introduced `let` and `const` keywords that provide block scope.
    * Variables declared with `let` or `const` within a block of code (e.g., `if` statement, loop, curly braces `{}`) are only accessible within that block and any nested blocks.
    * This enhances code clarity and reduces the risk of unintended variable modifications from outer scopes.

### Lexical Scope

* JavaScript adheres to lexical scope, also known as static scope.
* This means the scope of a variable or function is determined by its physical location in the code, not by where it's called from.
* Nested functions have access to variables and functions declared in their outer (enclosing) scopes, creating a hierarchy of accessibility.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Scope Type | Keyword | Accessibility |
|---|---|---|
| Global Scope | `var` (without any enclosing function) | Accessible from anywhere in the code |
| Function Scope (Before ES6) | `var` (inside a function) | Accessible within the function and its nested functions |
| Block Scope (ES6+) | `let` and `const` | Accessible only within the block and any nested blocks where it's declared |
| Lexical Scope | All | Nested functions can access variables and functions from their enclosing scopes |

**Example:**

```javascript
// Global variable
var globalVar = "Global";

function outerFunction() {
  // Function-scoped variable (Before ES6)
  var functionVar = "Function";

  if (true) {
    // Block-scoped variable (ES6+)
    let blockVar = "Block";
    console.log(globalVar, functionVar, blockVar); // All accessible here
  }

  console.log(globalVar, functionVar); // Only globalVar and functionVar accessible here

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(globalVar, functionVar); // Can access global and function-scoped variables
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();

// console.log(blockVar); // This will cause an error because blockVar is not accessible outside its block
```

*Especially block scope and lexical scope introduced in ES6, is crucial for writing well-structured and maintainable JavaScript code. It helps prevent naming conflicts and unexpected behavior.*


## Function Expression

In JavaScript, function expressions are an alternative way to define functions. Unlike function declarations, they treat functions as values and allow you to create functions on-the-fly and assign them to variables or pass them as arguments to other functions.

**Structure:**

A function expression typically follows this format:

```javascript
const functionName = function(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // Code to be executed
  return value; // Optional, specifies the value returned by the function
}
```

* `const functionName =`: (Optional) You can assign the function to a variable using `const` (or `let`) to give it a name for later reference. This is not mandatory for anonymous functions.
* `function(parameter1, parameter2, ...)`: Defines the function itself, similar to a function declaration.
* `// Code to be executed`: The statements that define the function's logic. This code executes when the function is called.
* `return value;`: (Optional) An expression that specifies the value the function returns after execution. If not specified, the function returns `undefined`.


### Anonymous Function Expression

```javascript
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

greet(); // Output: Hello!
```

*An anonymous function is created and assigned to the `greet` variable. The function is then called using the variable name.*

### Named Function Expression

```javascript
const doubler = function(number) {
  return number * 2;
};

const result = doubler(5);
console.log(result); // Output: 10
```

*A named function expression (`doubler`) is created and assigned to a variable. The function takes a number as input and returns its double.*

## Arrow Functions

- Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), arrow functions provide a concise syntax for defining functions.
- They are written using `=>` instead of the `function` keyword.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const myFunction = (argument1, argument2) => {
  // Function body
  return value; // Explicit return
};

const conciseFunction = argument => argument * 2; // Implicit return (single expression)
```

### Implicit Return

- Arrow functions with a single expression in their body can omit the `return` keyword.
- The expression itself is implicitly returned.

**Example:**

```javascript
const square = x => x * x; // Implicit return for a single expression
const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`; // Implicit return for string interpolation
```

### setTimeout

- The `setTimeout` function schedules a function to be executed **once** after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
- It's useful for delayed actions or animations.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
setTimeout(functionToExecute, delayInMilliseconds);
```

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This message appears after the delay.");
}, 2000); // Delay of 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds)
```

### setInterval

- The `setInterval` function schedules a function to be executed **repeatedly** at a specified interval (in milliseconds).
- It's commonly used for animations, timers, and background processes.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const intervalId = setInterval(functionToExecute, intervalInMilliseconds);
```

```javascript
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("This message appears repeatedly at the interval.");
}, 1000); // Interval of 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
```

**Key Points**

- Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` return an identifier (ID) that can be used to cancel the scheduled execution with `clearTimeout` or `clearInterval`, respectively.
- Arrow functions within `setTimeout` or `setInterval` inherit the `this` context from the surrounding scope.

**Example:**

```javascript
let count = 0;

const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log(`Count: ${count++}`);
  if (count === 5) {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  }
}, 1000);
```
