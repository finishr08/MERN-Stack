# JavaScript

**What is JavaScript?**

- A high-level, interpreted programming language.
- Primarily used to add interactivity to web pages.
- Makes web pages dynamic and responsive to user actions.

**Why is JavaScript Important?**

- Essential for creating modern, engaging web experiences.
- Powers features like:
    - Interactive forms
    - Animations
    - Data validation
    - Single-page applications (SPAs)
    - Can also be used for server-side development (Node.js) and game development.
    
## Variables

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords: `let`, `var`, and `const`. These keywords determine the scope and mutability (the ability to change the value) of the variable.

**`let` keyword**
   - Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) for block-level scoping.
   - Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block they are defined in (e.g., `if` statement, loop, or the entire code block wrapped in curly braces `{}`).
   - You can reassign values to `let` variables, making them mutable.

   ```javascript
   if (true) {
       let x = 10;
       console.log(x); // Output: 10 (accessible within the if block)
   }

   console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined (x is not accessible outside the if block)
   ```

**`var` keyword**
   - Introduced in the early days of JavaScript, it has function-level scoping.
   - Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the entire function they are defined in, regardless of code blocks.
   - `var` variables are also mutable.

   ```javascript
   function someFunction() {
       var y = 20;
       if (true) {
           console.log(y); // Output: 20 (accessible within the function)
       }
   }

   someFunction();
   ```

    Due to its function-level scoping, `var` can lead to unintended variable behavior, especially when dealing with nested functions. It's generally recommended to use `let` or `const` for better control and to avoid potential pitfalls.

**`const` keyword**
   - Introduced in ES6, `const` creates variables that hold constant values.
   - Once assigned a value, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned. This helps prevent accidental modifications and improves code readability.

   ```javascript
   const PI = 3.14159;
   PI = 123; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
   ```

## Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types to represent different kinds of information:

- **Numbers:** Integers (whole numbers) and floating-point numbers (decimals). Examples: `10`, `-5.23`, `0.00001`.
- **Strings:** Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Examples: `"Hello"`, `'World'`, `"This is a string"`.
- **Booleans:** Represent logical truth values: `true` or `false`.
- **Objects:** Collections of key-value pairs used to store complex data structures.
- **Arrays:** Ordered lists of values, similar to numbered boxes that can hold different types of data.
- **Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
- **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Symbol:** A unique and immutable primitive value used as an object property key.

## Operators & Precedence

Operators are used to perform calculations, comparisons, and other manipulations on data. JavaScript follows operator precedence rules to determine the order of operations in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. Here's a simplified table (higher precedence at the top):

```
**Operator**        **Description**                                     **Associativity**
------------------ -------------------------------------------------- ---------------
`()`, `[]`, `.`,  Function calls, property access, array indexing       Left to right
`postfix ++`,        Post-increment/decrement                             Right to left
`prefix ++`, `--`,  Pre-increment/decrement, unary plus/minus          Right to left
`*, /, %`           Multiplication, division, modulo                     Left to right
`+`, `-`            Addition, subtraction                                 Left to right
`<`, `>`, `<=`,     Comparison operators (less than, greater than, etc.)  Left to right
`==`, `!=`, `===`,  Equality and strict equality operators              Left to right
`&&`                Logical AND                                         Left to right
`||`                Logical OR                                          Left to right
`!`                 Logical NOT                                        Right to left
`=`                 Assignment                                          Right to left
```

**`NaN` (Not a Number)**

The `NaN` value represents a result that is not a valid number, often arising from operations that don't produce numerical results.

I'd be glad to explain assignment operators, unary operators, binary operators, and identifier rules in JavaScript with code examples:

## Assignment Operators

These operators assign a value to a variable on the left side based on the expression on the right side.

- **Simple Assignment (`=`):** Assigns the value on the right directly to the variable on the left.

```javascript
let age = 25;
console.log(age); // Output: 25
```

- **Compound Assignment Operators (combine assignment and operation)**
  - `+=`: Adds and assigns
  - `-=`: Subtracts and assigns
  - `*=`: Multiplies and assigns
  - `/=`: Divides and assigns
  - `%=`: Modulo (remainder) and assigns

```javascript
let count = 10;
count += 5; // Equivalent to count = count + 5
console.log(count); // Output: 15
```

## Unary Operators

These operators operate on a single operand (value).

- **Increment (`++`):** Increases the operand by 1 (can be pre-increment `++x` or post-increment `x++`).
- **Decrement (`--`):** Decreases the operand by 1 (can be pre-decrement `--x` or post-decrement `x--`).
- **Negate (`-`):** Converts a number to its negative equivalent.
- **Logical NOT (`!`):** Inverts the boolean value (true becomes false, false becomes true).

```javascript
let num = 3;
console.log(++num); // Output: 4 (pre-increment, num becomes 4)
console.log(num--); // Output: 4 (post-decrement, uses the current value 4)
console.log(num);  // Output: 3 (num is now 3 after decrement)

let isTrue = true;
console.log(!isTrue); // Output: false
```

## Binary Operators

These operators require two operands (values) to perform an operation.

- **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`):** Perform basic mathematical operations.
- **Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`):** Compare values and return true or false.
- **Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`):** Combine boolean expressions.
- **Bitwise Operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`):** Perform bit-level operations on numbers (less common).

```javascript
let a = 10, b = 5;
console.log(a + b);   // Output: 15 (addition)
console.log(a == b);  // Output: false (equality)
console.log(a && b);   // Output: 5 (logical AND, returns the second value)
console.log(a || b);   // Output: 10 (logical OR, returns the first truthy value)
```

## Identifier Rules

Identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) in JavaScript must follow these guidelines:

- **Start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_).**
- **Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores after the first character.**
- **Case-sensitive (e.g., `age` is different from `Age`).**
- **Cannot be reserved keywords (words with special meanings in JavaScript like `let`, `function`, `const`).**

Here are some valid and invalid identifiers:

```javascript
let firstName = "Alice";   // Valid
let _age = 30;            // Valid (starts with underscore)
let total$ = 100;         // Invalid (special character other than underscore)
let while = 10;           // Invalid (reserved keyword)
```

*By understanding these operators and identifier rules, you can effectively write JavaScript code to manipulate data and create complex logic.*


## Boolean Data Type

- Represent logical values: `true` or `false`.
- Used for conditional statements and comparisons.
- Example:

```javascript
let isSunny = true;
let isWeekend = false;

if (isSunny && isWeekend) {
  console.log("Perfect day for a picnic!");
}
```

## String Data Type

- Represent sequences of characters (text).
- Enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
- Can be used for displaying text, storing user input, etc.
- **String Indexes:** You can access individual characters within a string using their zero-based index. The first character has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.

```javascript
let message = "Hello, world!";

console.log(message[0]); // Output: "H" (character at index 0)
console.log(message.length); // Output: 14 (length of the string)
```

## Null Data Type

- A special value that indicates the absence of an object value.
- Not the same as an empty string or zero.
- Often used to represent intentional absence of data.

```javascript
let emptyBox = null;

console.log(emptyBox); // Output: null (no value assigned)
```

## Undefined Data Type

- Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- Also indicates a function's return value if the function doesn't explicitly return anything.
- Can lead to errors if not handled properly.

```javascript
let name;

console.log(name); // Output: undefined (declared but not assigned)

function greet() {
  // No return statement, so it implicitly returns undefined
}

let greeting = greet();
console.log(greeting); // Output: undefined
```

*Understanding these data types is crucial for working with variables and data in JavaScript. By using Booleans for logical operations, Strings for text, Null for intentional absence, and Undefined for variables declared but not assigned, you can write clear and efficient code.*

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. Developed by Microsoft, it offers several advantages for building large-scale and maintainable JavaScript applications.

**Key Features of TypeScript:**

- **Static Typing:** You can optionally define the data types (like number, string, boolean) of variables and function parameters. This helps catch errors early in the development process, improving code reliability.
- **Improved Tooling:** Code editors and IDEs can provide better code completion, refactoring, and error checking thanks to TypeScript's type annotations.
- **Transpilation:** TypeScript code is compiled into plain JavaScript that can run in any browser or JavaScript environment.
- **Interoperability:** Existing JavaScript code can be used seamlessly within TypeScript projects, making the transition smoother.

**Benefits of Using TypeScript:**

- **Reduced Errors:** Static typing helps prevent runtime errors by catching type mismatches during compilation.
- **Improved Code Readability:** Explicit type definitions make code easier to understand for yourself and other developers.
- **Better Maintainability:** Types make code more maintainable as the project grows, as changes are less likely to break unintended parts of the codebase.
- **Large-Scale Development:** TypeScript is well-suited for building complex applications as it promotes better organization and structure.

**Who Should Use TypeScript?**

While not strictly necessary for small projects, TypeScript is a valuable tool for:

- Developers working on large-scale or complex JavaScript applications.
- Teams collaborating on a codebase to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- Those who want to improve the reliability and readability of their JavaScript code.

## console.log

- **Purpose:** Used for debugging and logging messages to the browser's developer console.
- **Syntax:** `console.log(message1, message2, ...messageN);`
  - `messageN`: Any data type you want to output (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.).
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  const age = 30;
  console.log("My age is:", age);
  ```

## Linking JavaScript Files

- **`<script>` Tag:**
  - Place a `<script>` tag at the end of your HTML file to link an external JavaScript file:
    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Content</h1>
        <script src="myScript.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
  - The `src` attribute specifies the path to your JavaScript file.

## Template Literals

- **Purpose:** Create multi-line strings and embed expressions for cleaner string manipulation.
- **Syntax:** Use backticks (`) instead of quotes, with embedded expressions inside `${}`:
  ```javascript
  const name = "Alice";
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}! How are you today?`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice! How are you today?
  ```
- **Multiline Strings:** Template literals allow writing multi-line strings without concatenation:
  ```javascript
  const message = `This is a
  multiline string
  using template literals.`;
  console.log(message);
  ```

**JavaScript** operators are the building blocks that manipulate values, perform calculations, and control the flow of your code. Here's are some common operator types:

## Arithmetic Operators

- Used for mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation)
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const sum = 10 + 5;
  const difference = 20 - 7;
  const product = 3 * 4;
  console.log(sum, difference, product); // Output: 15 13 12
  ```

## Assignment Operators

- Assign values to variables.
- Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` (and similar for other operators)
  - The combined operators (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) perform the operation and then assign the result.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let count = 0;
  count += 2;  // Equivalent to count = count + 2;
  count *= 3;
  console.log(count); // Output: 6
  ```

## Comparison Operators

- Compare values for equality, inequality, greater than/less than, etc.
- Operators: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Use `===` for strict equality (checks type and value), and `!==` for strict inequality.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const a = 10;
  const b = "10";
  console.log(a == b);  // true (loose equality)
  console.log(a === b); // false (strict equality, different types)
  ```

## Logical Operators

- Combine conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `else`)
- Operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const age = 25;
  const isCitizen = true;
  if (age >= 18 && isCitizen) {
      console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
  }
  ```

## Other Operators

- **Unary Operators:** `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), `typeof` (check data type), `delete` (remove property)
- **Ternary Operator:** `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse` (shorthand conditional)
- **Bitwise Operators:** Perform bit-level operations (advanced usage)


## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in JavaScript are fundamental for controlling the flow of your code based on certain conditions. Here's a breakdown of the main ones:

### if Statement

- Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- Syntax:
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if condition is true
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const age = 25;
  if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You are an adult.");
  }
  ```

### else Statement

- Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the `if` condition is false.
- Syntax:
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if condition is true
  } else {
      // Code to execute if condition is false
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const isWeekend = true;
  if (isWeekend) {
      console.log("Enjoy your weekend!");
  } else {
      console.log("Back to work!");
  }
  ```

### else if Statement

- Allows checking for multiple conditions sequentially.
- Syntax:
  ```javascript
  if (condition1) {
      // Code to execute if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
      // Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  } else {
      // Code to execute if all previous conditions are false
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const grade = 85;
  if (grade >= 90) {
      console.log("Excellent!");
  } else if (grade >= 80) {
      console.log("Very good!");
  } else {
      console.log("Keep practicing!");
  }
  ```

### Nested if-else

In JavaScript, nested `if` and `else` statements allow you to create complex decision-making logic by checking multiple conditions within a single block. Here's a breakdown:

**Nested `if` with `else`**

   ```javascript
   if (condition1) {
       if (condition2) {
           // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
       } else {
           // Code to execute if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
       }
   } else {
       // Code to execute if condition1 is false
   }
   ```

**Nested `if`/`else if` chains**

   ```javascript
   if (condition1) {
       // Code to execute if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
   } else if (condition3) {
       // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
   } else {
       // Code to execute if all previous conditions are false
   }
   ```

**Example:**

```javascript
const grade = 88;
let letterGrade;

if (grade >= 90) {
    letterGrade = "A";
} else if (grade >= 80) {
    letterGrade = "B";
} else if (grade >= 70) {
    letterGrade = "C";
} else {
    letterGrade = "D or F";
}

console.log("Your letter grade is:", letterGrade);
```

In this example, the code checks the `grade` value against multiple conditions and assigns the corresponding letter grade.


**Tips**

- Always use curly braces `{}` to group the code within each conditional block, even if it's a single line.
- Indentation is recommended for better readability, but not strictly enforced by JavaScript.
- Choose the appropriate conditional statement based on the complexity of your conditions.

*By effectively using these conditional statements, you can make your JavaScript code more dynamic and responsive to different scenarios.*

### Switch Statements

In JavaScript, switch statements offer a structured approach to handling multiple conditional checks based on the value of a single expression. They are particularly useful when you want to compare a value against several possible options and execute specific code blocks for each match.

```javascript
const day = "Wednesday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Start of the week!");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
  case "Wednesday":
  case "Thursday":
    console.log("Midweek grind.");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("TGIF!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Enjoy your weekend!");
}
```

*In this example, the day variable is evaluated in the switch statement. If it matches "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", or "Thursday", the corresponding message is printed. Otherwise, the default message is used.*

## Alert & Prompt

Alert and prompt are built-in functions in JavaScript used for interacting with the user through modal dialog boxes. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

### Alert

- **Purpose:** Displays a simple message box with an "OK" button that the user must click to dismiss.
- **Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  alert(message);
  ```
  - `message`: The string you want to display in the alert box.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  alert("Hello, world!");
  ```
  When you run this code, a modal window will appear with the message "Hello, world!" and an "OK" button. The user must click "OK" to proceed.

### Prompt

- **Purpose:** Displays a dialog box with a message, an input field for the user to enter text, and "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.
- **Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  const userInput = prompt(message, defaultValue);
  ```
  - `message`: The text displayed before the input field.
  - `defaultValue` (optional): The initial value displayed in the input field (can be a string or null).
- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the text entered by the user if they click "OK," or `null` if they click "Cancel" or close the dialog box without entering any text.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  const name = prompt("What is your name?");
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  ```
  This code displays a prompt asking the user for their name. When the user enters their name and clicks "OK," the code stores the entered name in the `name` variable and then prints a greeting message using `console.log`. If the user clicks "Cancel" or closes the dialog box without entering anything, `null` will be assigned to `name`, and the console might log `"Hello, null!"` if appropriate error handling isn't implemented.

**Important!**

- Both `alert` and `prompt` can disrupt the user experience by pausing script execution and forcing users to interact with the modal dialog. Use them sparingly and consider alternative approaches like providing informational messages within the webpage itself or using more interactive UI elements.
- The `prompt` function's return value can be `null`, so always check for this before using the entered text in your code to avoid potential errors. You might want to implement validation or provide a default value if the user cancels the prompt.
- These functions are generally used for simple interactions. For more complex user input and interactions, consider using HTML forms and JavaScript event listeners.

*By understanding the use cases and limitations of `alert` and `prompt`, you can effectively incorporate them in your JavaScript code when appropriate.*
