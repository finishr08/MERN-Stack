# Level 1 HTML

This document serves as a guide for your Level 1 HTML journey, introducing fundamental tags for structuring and formatting web content.

## Key Concepts

### Heading Tags

* Provide hierarchical structure to page sections.
* Use `<h1>` for the main title, `<h2>` for subtitles, and so on, descending to `<h6>`.

### Paragraph Tag

* Defines a block of text, typically wrapped at line breaks.
* Use `<p>` for each distinct paragraph.

### Bold Tag

* Boldface specific text to emphasize it.
* Use `<b>` for simple highlighting, or consider more semantic alternatives like `<strong>` for important information.
