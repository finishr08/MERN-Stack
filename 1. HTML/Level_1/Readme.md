# Level 1 HTML

This document serves as a guide for your Level 1 HTML journey, introducing fundamental tags for structuring and formatting web content.

## Key Concepts

### Heading Tags

* Provide hierarchical structure to page sections.
* Use `<h1>` for the main title, `<h2>` for subtitles, and so on, descending to `<h6>`.

### Paragraph Tag

* Defines a block of text, typically wrapped at line breaks.
* Use `<p>` for each distinct paragraph.

### Bold Tag

* Boldface specific text to emphasize it.
* Use `<b>` for simple highlighting, or consider more semantic alternatives like `<strong>` for important information.

### List Tag

* Order lists `<ol>` display items in a specific order with numerical bullets.
* Unordered lists `<ul>` display items without a specific order, often using bullet points.
* Use list items `<li>` within each list.

### Anchors

* Create links to other sections of the same page or external websites.
* Use `<a>` with a href attribute specifying the target location.


### Images
* Embed images into your webpage.
* Use `<img>` with attributes like `src` (image source) and `alt` (alternative text for accessibility).


### Comments

* Add hidden notes for yourself or collaborators.
* Use for (multi-line comments) and for short notes.
